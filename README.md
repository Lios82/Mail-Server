During the course, Structured Programming Language, I was responsible to complete this project using C Programming Language. This is actually a console application where end user(s) can login/signup to the system and communicate via email message. 
This is my first project and it gives me a terrible experience in C Programming Language and File Processing. But also from this, I realized why to use Database to build a system and why to choose object oriented programming language. Thank you.
